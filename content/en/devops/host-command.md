`host` is a very useful MacOs command, it helps you to lookup for any DNS record right from your terminal. 

Use case:

Let's say you added a new `A` record or nameserver or even CNAME record for your server and you want to check if it was propagated. 

You can use a service like [https://dnschecker.org/](https://dnschecker.org/) for that, or you can use the `host` command right from your machine.

## Host command 

**Descriptions:**

    host is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups.It is normally 
    used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no 
    arguments or options are given, hhoosstt prints a short summary 
    of its command line arguments and options.

    name is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a 
    dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, 
    in which case hhoosstt will by default perform a reverse lookup 
    for that address. Server is an optional argument which is either 
    the name or IP address of the name server that hhoosstt should 
    query instead of the server or servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf.


**Options:**

    -4
        Use IPv4 only for query transport. See also the --66 option.

    -6
        Use IPv6 only for query transport. See also the --44 option.

    -a
        "All". The --aa option is normally equivalent to 
        --vv --tt AANNYY. It also affects the behaviour of the
        --ll list zone option.

    -c
        Query class: This can be used to lookup HS (Hesiod) or 
        CH (Chaosnet) class resource records. The default class is 
        IN (Internet).

    -C
        Check consistency: hhoosstt will query the SOA records for zone 
        _n_a_m_e from all the listed authoritative name servers for 
        that zone. The list of name servers is defined by the NS 
        records that are found for the zone.

    -d
        Print debugging traces. Equivalent to the --vv verbose option.
           

    -i
        Obsolete. Use the IP6.INT domain for reverse lookups of IPv6 
        addresses as defined in RFC1886 and deprecated in RFC4159.
        The default is to use IP6.ARPA as specified in RFC3596.

    -l
        List zone: The hhoosstt command performs a zone transfer 
        of zone _n_a_m_e and prints out the NS, PTR and address 
        records (A/AAAA).
        
        Together, the --ll --aa options print all records in the zone.

    -N
        The number of dots that have to be in _n_a_m_e for it to be 
        considered absolute. The default value is that defined using 
        the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or 1 if no ndots 
        statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as
        relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed
        in the sseeaarrcchh or ddoommaaiinn directive 
        in /etc/resolv.conf.
           

    -r
        Non-recursive query: Setting this option clears the RD 
        (recursion desired) bit in the query. This should mean that 
        the name server receiving the query will not attempt to 
        resolve _n_a_m_e. The --rr option enables hhoosstt to mimic
        the behavior of a name server by making non-recursive queries
        and expecting to receive answers to those queries that can 
        be referrals to other name servers.

    -R
        Number of retries for UDP queries: If _n_u_m_b_e_r is negative
        or zero, the number of retries will default to 1. The default 
        value is 1.

    -s
        Do _n_o_t send the query to the next nameserver if any server
        responds with a SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of 
        normal stub resolver behavior.

    -t   
        Query type: The _t_y_p_e argument can be any recognized query 
        type: CNAME, NS, SOA, TXT, DNSKEY, AXFR, etc.

        When no query type is specified, hhoosstt automatically 
        selects an appropriate query type. By default, it looks for
        A, AAAA, and MX records. If the --CC option is given, queries
        will be made for SOA records. If _n_a_m_e is a dotted-decimal
        IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 address, hhoosstt 
        will query for PTR records.

        If a query type of IXFR is chosen the starting serial number
        can be specified by appending an equal followed by the starting 
        serial number (like --tt IIXXFFRR==1122334455667788).

    -T
        TCP: By default, hhoosstt uses UDP when making queries. 
        The --TT option makes it use a TCP connection when querying the 
        name server. TCP will be automatically selected for queries 
        that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests.

    -m 
        Memory usage debugging: the flag can be _r_e_c_o_r_d,
        _u_s_a_g_e, or _t_r_a_c_e. You can specify the --mm option 
        more than once to set multiple flags.

    -v
        Verbose output. Equivalent to the --dd debug option.

    -V
        Print the version number and exit.

    -w
        Wait forever: The query timeout is set to the maximum possible. 
        See also the --WW option.

    -W
        Timeout: Wait for up to _w_a_i_t seconds for a reply. 
        If _w_a_i_t is less than one, the wait interval is set to one 
        second.

        By default, hhoosstt will wait for 5 seconds for UDP responses 
        and 10 seconds for TCP connections.

        See also the --ww option.


## Host usage

Here are some 'real life' examples. 

### A record

Command:

```bash
host -t A binarcode.com
```

Output: 

```bash
binarcode.com has address 104.198.14.52
```

### CNAME record

Command:

```bash
host -t CNAME em5860.binarcode.com.
```

Output:

```bash
em5860.binarcode.com is an alias for u15784123.wl124.sendgrid.net.
```

### nameserver NS record

Command:

```bash
host -t ns binarcode.com.
```

Output:

```bash
binarcode.com name server ns4.mxserver.ro.
binarcode.com name server ns2.mxserver.ro.
binarcode.com name server ns3.mxserver.ro.
binarcode.com name server ns1.mxserver.ro
```

### ip address for nameserver

Command: 

```bash
host -t a ns3.mxserver.ro
```

Output:

```bash
ns3.mxserver.ro has address 159.89.237.53
```


## DIG command

A similar command is the `dig` command. However, it gives you more information unless `host` does, `host`
feels more clean, it gives you want you need and nothing more.

Command: 
```bash
dig A binarcode
```

Output:

```bash
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> A binarcode.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 24895
;; flags: qr rd ra; 
;; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 58
```

### dig short

As we can see `dig` gives a lot of information. There is a handy options you can get back exactly what your're looking for: 


```bash
dig +short A binarcode.com
```

Output:

```bash
104.198.14.52
```
